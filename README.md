# roger-skyline- 1 project @ 42

This project aims to familiarize us with the work of a sysadmin. I had to configure a linux distribution with some basics services like OpenSSH, Fail2Ban, a web server (Nginx) etc..

## Pre-requies

Thoses pre-requies are needed to work fully with Ansible for an automated deployment, otherwise you can look at ```Method 2``` and adjust your own settings.
1. A minimal Ubuntu 18.04 LTS iso (netboot) : <http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/bionic/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso>

2. VirtualBox :
  - Adapter 1 : ```NAT```

  - Adapter 2 : ```Host-only Adapter``` with ```vboxnet```
   - IPv4 : ```192.168.56.1```
   - IPv4 Network Mask : ```255.255.255.252```
   - DHCP Server : Disabled

3. Installation
  - Partition of 8GB
  - 3GB for ```/```
   - 1 GB for ```SWAP```

   -	Set username to ```arsciand```

   -	Set password to ```1319```

4. Add the ```assets/rs1-key``` and ```assets/rs1-key.pub``` to your ```~/.ssh``` folder

5. The passphrase for this key is ```qwerty```

## Method 1 (Fully automated deployment with Ansible)

After all the pre-requies checked, just boot your VM and runs the followings commands to install git and clone this repo
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install git -y
git clone https://github.com/acuD1/roger-skyline-1.git
```

Then run ```setup.sh```.
```
./roger-skyline-1/setup.sh
```

The script will install ```vim ccze ansible``` and then execute ```rs1-playbook.yml```. This playbook will installs and configures the following roles:

- netplan
- openssh ```port 2222```
- netdata
- nginx
- postfix
- ufw
- fail2ban
- cron_script
- parted

Each roles can be configured under ```/Ansible/roles```, or removed by simply commenting their lines in ```rs1-playbook.yml```

After the execution of the Ansible playbook, you can check the deployment by running
```
./roger-skyline-1/rerun.sh
```

You can now open your browser at https://192.168.56.2, it shows Netdata

## Method 2 (By command line)

See ```tutorial.txt```
